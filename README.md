The code here is a fork of the work started by @mrmidi, you can find the original version here: https://github.com/manifestinteractive/teleprompter

This version has been updated to provide support for loading text files from a DropBox account. It adds a button to the navigation that allows you to authenticate with DropBox and choose a file. The content of that file is then loaded into the prompter.

This version also introduces a 10 second countdown between the time you press the play button and the time the text starts scrolling in the prompter.

See it in action and make use of it here: http://eojthebrave.github.io/teleprompter/

## Teleprompter ##

You can edit the text right on the page. It'll even save your changes for you if you happen to leave the page.

If you're using an iPad, you can add a shortcut to your home screen for full screen awesomeness.

You can also use some handy keyboard shortcuts. You can adjust the speed & font size at the top right as well. I'm also experimenting with ways to flip the text around for you fancy folks using mirrors.

Finally, we also made an effort to make sure your text will be easy to read.   So if you are pasting text from a word document, we'll do some cleaning up to make the breaks flow more easily.
